# Smartphone-Feature-Ranking
Background: The ever-evolving smartphone market is highly competitive, and understanding consumer demand is essential for product development. This project addresses the need for a data-driven approach to identify and rank the most desired smartphone features based on user requests.

Brief: This Python application is designed to simulate a data science workflow, from data generation to analysis. The project involves the following technology scopes:
Python: The core programming language for the application.
Pandas: A powerful data analysis library used for data generation, cleaning, classification, and ranking.
Faker: A Python library used to create a synthetic dataset of user requests for demonstration purposes.

The application's final output is a ranked list of both hardware and software features, providing a clear overview of consumer preferences.
